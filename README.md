# Fullscreen_Automation_QA_Challenge

There is 1 test class and 2 page object classes.

I separated the requirements into 3 different test cases on the test class.


First Test Case covers: 
Web page has elements:
Google logo (or whatever custom image above the search bar)
Search entry field
Sign in button
I'm Feeling Lucky button



Second Test Case covers:
User can't sign in with invalid credentials (please use non-existing google username)




Third Test Case covers:
Search is functional:
Trigger search using fullscreen direct keywords
Verify results page displays more than five results
Verify that first search result has URL: https://www.fullscreendirect.com/
Verify that clicking first search result does redirect to Fullscreen Direct website




Test cases can be ran individually or or as a suite of tests by clicking "run" by the class declaration

I created 2 page object classes. One for google homepage, the other for the gmail sign in page.
